    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <button> Mystery Button! </button>
    <p class="Banner2">I am a girl who attends Cupertino High School in Cupertino, CA, and I will be a senior in the upcoming year. I enjoy learning about CS and it is something I am interested in pursuing in the future. I live with my family, which includes my mom, my dad, and my younger sister. I also like to read and hang out with my friends as well as bake desserts. I also enjoy doing martial arts (I’m a second degree black belt!).</p>

    <h3>Robot Dance Party Project:</h3>

    <p class="Banner2">Last week, I built a cool robot using Arduino that can perform a dance routine. I learned how to program the servo motors attached to the robot, as well as how to make sound using the piezo speaker. Additionally, the robot could light up through the connected LEDs. Check out the pic below!</p>
